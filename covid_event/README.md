### Changelog
- 2020-10-15, add fine-tuned t5-base model.

### Demo ([inference.py](inference.py))

```python3
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, TFT5ForConditionalGeneration, T5ForConditionalGeneration
# the model will be downloaded automatically from Huggingface's model hub, corresponding to run-1 in the paper.
model_name_or_path = "congcongwang/t5-large-fine-tuned-wnut-2020-task3"
# Tensorflow2.0
model = TFT5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)

# Or try replace "congcongwang/t5-large-fine-tuned-wnut-2020-task3" with ""congcongwang/t5-base-fine-tuned-wnut-2020-task3" that is much lighter than the but still hits a decent performance (see table 2a)

# or PyTorch
# model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)

source = "context: *Prince Charles tests positive for Corona* Prince William knowing he's " \
         "the next in line to the throne: https://t.co/B1nmIpLj69. question: Who is tested positive?" \
         "choices: author of the tweet, not specified, the next in line, line to the throne, *Prince Charles," \
         " Corona* Prince William, he, the next, line, the throne."

inputs = tokenizer.encode(source, return_tensors="tf")  # Batch size 1. change "tf" to "pt" if using pytorch model
result = model.generate(inputs)
# output: Prince Charles
```

### Quick reproduction

#### reproduction of table 2b
```bash
python eval.py --run_name run-3 
python eval.py --run_name run-2 
python eval.py --run_name run-1
```

Now `python subs/post_process.py` to post processe these runs to `post-run-3`, `post-run-2`, and `post-run-1` respectively, which corresponds to the runs in table 2c. To reproduce the results in table 2c, then run the following commands

```bash
python eval.py --run_name post-run-3 
python eval.py --run_name post-run-2 
python eval.py --run_name post-run-1
```

### Reproduction from scratch

#### Data preparation

Download the corpus from [this repository](https://github.com/viczong/extract_COVID19_events_from_Twitter/tree/master/shared_task) or sent an email at  [wangcongcongcc@gmail.com](wangcongcongcc@gmail.com) to request the 7149 tweets used in the paper. Then name the obtained corpus as `corpus.json` and put it under `./data` (create it first). In `corpus.json`, each line represents an example with jsonl format as follows:

```bash
{"id_str": "...", "full_text": "...", "candidate_chunks_offsets": [[34, 40], [51, 56], [58, 62], [67, 70], [127, 137], [12, 28]], "annotation": {"part1.Response": ["..."], "part2-relation.Response": ["..."], "part2-symptoms.Response": ["..."], "part2-name.Response": ["..."], "part2-when.Response": ["..."], "part2-where.Response": ["..."]}, "event_type": "can_not_test"}
```
Then run the command to prepare the training and validation set (splitting and constructing the source and target sequences) ready for subsequent model training.

```bash
python prepare.py
```

This will generate two folders with `train.json` and `val.json` inside`./data/middle` and `./data/final`. The  `./data/final` is what we need to for model training. To do the same process for test set, request `test.json` at [wangcongcongcc@gmail.com](wangcongcongcc@gmail.com) first and make some changes in `prepare.py` accordingly to prepare the test set.

#### Fine-tune T5
To skip the following time-consuming fine-tuning, it is recommended to download the already fine-tuned model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuI54jDK7OfiVemninyZbUo3sybYHosg/view?usp=sharing), which is fine-tuned on T5-large with 12 epochs (corresponding to run-1 in the paper) and ready for predictions. After downloading, unzip and put it `./tmp/` (create it first).

Before fine-tuning, ensure to install the dependencies first:

````
git clone https://github.com/wangcongcong123/ttt.git
cd ttt
pip install -e .
````

Start fine-tuning with Tensorflow2.0

```
python finetune.py --model_select t5-small --data_path data/final --task t2t --per_device_train_batch_size 8 --num_epochs_train 12 --max_src_length 512 --max_tgt_length 78 --lr 5e-5 --schedule warmuplinear --warmup_ratio 0.1 --log_steps -1 --keep_ck_num 3 --use_gpu --source_field_name source --target_field_name target
```

Or you prefer fine-tuning with PyTorch.

```python
python finetune_pt.py
```

Reminders
* Try `python finetune.py --help` or `python finetune_pt.py --help` to know the flags.
* `finetune_pt.py` has the same set of flags as the TF one using one GPU by default. To manipulate the flags, have a look at the script.
* For `finetune.py`, it fine-tunes a T5-small with GPU as an example. If you have more resources like TPUs to train larger models, just change flag `--use-gpu`, to `--use_tpu` and add an extra flag `--tpu_address x.x.x.x`. 

After the fine-tuning is done, the training details and model weights (checkpoints of last three epochs) can be found at `./tmp/{model_save_path}`.

#### Predictions

Assume the trained model is saved to `./tmp/t5-large-fine-tuned-wnut-2020-task3`

```
python predict.py
```

** This will make predictions for `data/final/val.json` and output the predictions to `./preds/val_preds.json`.

#### Submission

Since the predictions are made in flat over slots. We need to merge them by tweet ids to meet [the required format](https://github.com/viczong/extract_COVID19_events_from_Twitter/tree/master/shared_task) before evaluation. In `subs/` includes a fixture of `val_preds.json` for example here. To convert it:

```python
python submit.py
```

After this, the converted predictions are saved to `subs/val-run-1/`. We now have the runs ready for evaluation (the same as the test runs as mentioned in the [quick reproduction](#quick) section).
